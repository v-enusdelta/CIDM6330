# Assignment Requirements

1. Django O/RM for repository
2. Translate your API into one that uses the Django REST Framework (or Django Ninja)
3. Messaging and Events with Celery/Redis
4. Extend your API Beyond CRUD to perform a few operations that are consistent with your design
5. At least some of these operations shuold include placing tasks on worker and task queues in Celery/Redis
6. Create tests for these methods using Django's Unittest framework

## Requirements Interpretation
1. (1a) Create a Django project that combines O/RM and REST framework using the same theme as assignment 4 with the ability to perform CRUD operations
2. (2a) Write at least one additional operation consistent with Assignment 2's ERD
3. (3a) Implement Celery+Redis into this project for at least one operation
4. (4a) Create tests using Django's unittest framework
