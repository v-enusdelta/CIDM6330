# Assignment Requirements

1. Implement a repository for your project/API
2. Translate your API into one that uses the Django REST Framework
3. Use the built-in Django O/RM rather than the Repository we hand-crafter [sic] previously

## Requirements Interpretation
1. (1a) Create a Django project that uses O/RM and utilizes db.sqlite3 using the same themes as assignment 2 and 3.
2. (2a) Create a separate Django API project that uses the REST Framework and replicate what you did in step 1a but using this different method instead. ALSO create a separate repository for the API to talk to.
